        - Title
        - Effective Date
        - Parties
        - Contract Terms
        - Contract Description

        ONLY consider it a direct request when the message:
        1. Directly asks the user to provide or enter specific information for a property
        2. Gives a clear instruction that expects immediate user input for a property
        3. Asks ""What is..."" or ""Please enter..."" or ""Can you provide..."" for a specific property

        DO NOT consider it a direct request when the message:
        - Asks for confirmation (""Would you like to use..."", ""Is this correct..."", ""Should I..."")
        - Provides suggestions and asks for approval
        - Offers options and asks the user to choose or confirm
        - Contains phrases like ""Would you like"", ""Do you want"", ""Should I"", ""Is this""

        Use semantic understanding to map the message intent to the most appropriate property:
        - Title: Contract names, headings, document titles
        - Effective Date: Start dates, commencement, when agreements begin
        - Parties: People, organizations, signatories, contracting entities
        - Contract Terms: Any contractual provisions, clauses, conditions, legal language, terms and conditions, obligations, rights, restrictions, or regulatory requirements
        - Contract Description: A description of the contract, including the purpose, scope, and key terms.

        Return exactly the property name (one of the above) if and only if there is a direct request for user input. For confirmation requests, suggestions, or any non-direct requests, return null.

        Return exactly the property name (one of the above) if and only if there is a direct request. Otherwise, return null. Do not return any additional text.
